# python-smart-crop

Smart crops images uisng OpenCV

Uses the algorithms described in https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor/wiki/Detection-algorithms but actually combining both methods. We try to detect faces on the image, then, in any case we detect features. We then combine both results with different weights, so face detection is, in this case 3,33 times stronger than feature detection.
